That’s because many of the expectations users have for mobile apps today -- for the application to work regardless of network connectivity, to notify them when relevant content changes, to have integrations with the social networks they use, for appropriate levels of security, and a hundred other things -- are reliant on the app’s back-end services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common pattern for mobile back-ends we see today is for developers to design, build and maintain their back-end architectures on Heroku. This approach is as flexible as it is powerful, but it requires significant engineering effort.  A faster alternative would be to use a service like Parse.  Using the Parse SDKs gets you some great services right out of the box. However, if you need to add customized functionality to your application at scale, there just isn\u0026#39;t a simple way to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n","tags":["mobile","parse"],"published_at":"2015-10-22T17:00:20.586Z","permalink":"http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2015/10/22/heroku-plus-parse"},{"title":"Introducing Heroku Private Spaces: Private PaaS, delivered as-a-Service","content":"\u003cp\u003eAs the world becomes more cloud-centric, and more of our apps and business depend on its capabilities, the trust, control and management of cloud services is more important than ever.  Since the first days of Heroku  — and Platform-as-a-Service in general  — many companies have struggled to balance the impact and success of the cloud with the control offered by traditional software and on-premise infrastructure.  Too often that balance tips back towards software, with companies choosing to meet those requirements by building and running their own platforms, inevitably becoming frustrated by the resulting complexity, cost and poor experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday Heroku is introducing Private Spaces, a new Heroku runtime that delivers the best of both worlds; the simplicity and success of the cloud, combined with the network and trust controls historically only available with on premise, behind the firewall deployments.  Available today in public beta, Private Spaces is powered by Heroku Dogwood  — an all-new runtime architecture that augments the current Cedar runtime. Spaces are being released as part of \u003ca href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2015/09/salesforce-app-cloud.html\"\u003eSalesforce’s new App Cloud\u003c/a\u003e, also launching today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 class='anchored'\u003e\n  \u003ca name='heroku-private-spaces' href='#heroku-private-spaces'\u003eHeroku Private Spaces\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA Heroku Private Space contains all of the familiar elements of a Heroku app, including dynos and data services.  These elements are deployed and run in network isolated environments, separating the “private” application, including its associated data, from the “public” systems that keep it up, running and healthy.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new mix of multi-tenant control plane with private runtimes is what makes this architecture unique, and allows it to share an identical development and deployment experience with the Heroku you know today. You develop and deploy apps in Private Spaces just like you would normally on Heroku; Heroku Button, git push deployments, review apps, pipelines, seamless scaling, self healing and Elements Ecosystem  — are all included in Private Spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven better, this isolation architecture also allows for more geographic control; Spaces can be deployed in Frankfurt, Germany, Tokyo, Japan, or in the United States in either Virginia or Oregon, with more regions to be added in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n","tags":[],"published_at":"2015-09-10T12:05:36.218Z","permalink":"http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2015/9/10/heroku_private_spaces_private_paas_delivered_as_a_service"},{"title":"Integrated security with Heroku Identity Federation","content":"\u003cp\u003eApps are at the heart of modern businesses, and are important assets that need a secure platform geared for compliance and security.
